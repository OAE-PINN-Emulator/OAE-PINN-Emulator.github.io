# OAE PINN Emulator

A Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)-based emulator for tracer transport in Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) simulations.

This site is coming together as I finalize my masters thesis at Yale's Earth and Planetary science department. 
  
Up next: the [codebase](code.md) and a small [playground](playground.md) for the trained models.
